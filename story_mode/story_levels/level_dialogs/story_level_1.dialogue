~ intro
Socks: Hiya, I'm Socks.
Socks: We've got a busy day ahead of us, starting with helping my person, Jenny.
- What does she need help with?
	Socks: She needs to get up and feed me! [wait=0.75] I mean go to work.
	We need to help her get up and get ready for work. 
- Okay, I can do that.
Socks: Do you know how to write a basic word?
- Of course
	=> try_walk
- Not really
	=> steno_basics


~ steno_basics
Socks: In stenography, you write words by hitting multiple keys at once. 
	Sounds at the start of the word or syllable are on the left.
	Vowel sounds are on the thumb keys.
	And sounds at the end of the word or syllable are on the right.
Socks: Are you familiar with the steno keyboard?
- Yes
- A bit
	=> offer_hints
- No
	=> offer_hints



~ try_walk
Socks: If you get stuck, you can always toggle hints for words on and off by hitting Enter (R-R), just in case.
Socks: Okay! We're going to start with words that have short vowels like 'cat', 'get', 'kid', 'top', and 'mud'.
Socks: Short vowels have two main rules: [wait=0.75]
	If you spell them with one letter, use that key to write them in a word. [wait=0.5]
	If you spell them with more than one letter, use the key that matches the sound they make.
Socks: We'll start with the short 'a' sound like in "cat".
do display_stroke("A")
Socks: Speaking of cats, have I mentioned how awesome I am?
Socks: Oh, be careful with words that have an 'r' - they can make the vowel sound a little funny. Look at the word 'car' [do display_stroke("KAR")] it doesn't sound like the 'a' in 'cat', but it's written with the A key!
Socks: Hit Enter or click anywhere to close my dialogue and try walking to one of the nearby points.
do hide_stroke()
do level.level_word_list.start_quest("first_steps")
=> END

~ offer_hints
Socks: Do you want to enable hints to show you how to stroke the words you'll find around the house?
- Yes
	do set_hints_visible(true)
- No
	do set_hints_visible(false)
=> try_walk

~ teach_interact
Socks: You've got me moving. Good start, but Jenny's a heavy sleeper. Walking around probably isn't going to do it.
Socks: If you reach a place where I can do something, a new word will appear in [color={{PlayerConfig.interact_font_color}}] this color[/color].
	[wait=0.2]Just stroke the word and I'll do the rest!
do level.level_word_list.start_quest("first_interact")
=> END

~ teach_gen_action
Socks: I forgot to tell you! I can do some things from [i]anywhere[/i]. 
	I can always meow, I'm very sociable! 
Socks: You can see my general actions and the words to use them in the bottom right.
Socks: Now you can help me wake Jenny up so that she's not late.
	All you need to do is stroke the word you see to tell me where to go. 
do level.level_word_list.start_quest("wake_up_jenny")
=> END

~ Jenny_woke_up
Socks: Oh good! She's finally up. Now we can get out of here and see the rest of the house.
do level.level_word_list.start_quest("open_the_door")
=> END

~ meowed_at_door
Socks: You might have to keep trying,
	Jenny's my favorite human, but...[wait=0.5]
	She's not always the best listener.
=> END

~ Jenny_opens_door
Jenny: Okay, okay. You can go out, Socks, but you know there isn't any food out there yet.
Socks: Did she say something about food? Let's go check my bowl!
do level.level_word_list.start_quest("check_bowl")
=> END


~ teach_o_vowel
Socks: Seems like you're getting the hang of things. Let's add something new.
Socks: Short 'o' is the sound in 'cot', 'dog', or 'rod'. 
do display_stroke("O")
Socks: It's also the sound in 'pore' or 'worn' - there's 'r' making things sound a little funny. 
Socks: You can include it in a word using the O key. Now get going - there's more to do!
do hide_stroke()

~ teach_e_vowel
Socks: Time for another vowel! Short 'e' is the sound in 'bed', 'men', and 'leg'. 
do display_stroke("E")
Socks: It's also the sound in 'her' or 'per'
do display_stroke("HER")
Socks: Be careful with the 'er' sound - it can also be spelled 'ir', like 'fir', or 'ur' like 'purr'. Remember the short vowel rules and use the key that matches the spelling. 
do hide_stroke()

~ teach_u_vowel
Socks: You know the drill by now, right? Our next vowel is short 'u', which you can hear in 'bus', 'fun', and 'tub'.
do display_stroke("U")
Socks: Remember what I told you about things that sound like 'er' - pay attention to the spelling. 'Her' is written with the E key, but 'fur' is written with U. 
do hide_stroke()

~ teach_i_vowel
Socks: Oh, you thought I was done? I have way more to teach you!
Socks: There might not be any more vowel keys, but English definitely has more vowels.
The last one for today is short 'i' - the sound in 'bit', 'tin', and 'miss'. 
Socks: This one uses two keys. Stroke E and U at the same time for the short vowel 'i'. 
do display_stroke("EU")
Socks: Remember that if you hear a short vowel spelled with one letter, you should use the letter that matches the spelling.
That means 'sir' is written like this.
do display_stroke("SEUR")
Socks: That's everything I have to teach you right now. You'd better hurry up and get things sorted out here so that we can get on with the rest of the day!
